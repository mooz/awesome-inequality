## Use cases

### [Hoeffding's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality)

Used to derive confidence interval in approximate query processing.

### [Jensen's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality)

Used to derive tractable lower bound of model evidence in variational Bayesian inference (variational auto encoders also).

### [Triangle inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_inequality)

Basis of spatial indexing methods. Can reduce the number of candidates in similarity search.

### [Cauchy–Schwarz inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Schwarz_inequality)

Can be used to approximate dot product and prune candidates in similarity search.

### [Holder's_inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder%27s_inequality)

Generalization of Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
